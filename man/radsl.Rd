\arguments{
\item{N}{Number of patients.}

\item{study_duration}{Duration of study in years.}

\item{seed}{Seed for random number generation.}

\item{with_trt02}{If period 2 is needed, set duration of period 2 in years.}

\item{na_percentage}{(\code{numeric}) Default percentage of values to be replaced by NA}

\item{na_vars}{(\code{list}) A named list where the name of each element is a column name of \code{ds}. Each
 element of this list should be a numeric vector with two elements
 \itemize{
    \item{seed }{The seed to be used for this element - can be left NA}
    \item{percentage }{How many element should be replaced. 0 is 0 \% 1 is 100 \%, can be left NA and default
    percentage is used. This will overwrite default percentage (percentage argument))}
}}

\item{ae_withdrawal_prob}{Probability that there is at least one Adverse Event
leading to the withdrawal of a study drug.}

\item{cached}{boolean whether the cached ADSL data \code{cadsl} should be returned or new data
should be generated. If set to \code{TRUE} then the other arguments to \code{radsl} will be ignored.}

\description{
The Subject-Level Analysis Data set (ADSL) is used to provide the variables
that describe attributes of a subject. ADSL is a source for subject-level
variables used in other analysis data sets, such as population flags and
treatment variables. There is only one ADSL per study. ADSL and its related
metadata are required in a CDISC-based submission of data from a clinical
trial even if no other analysis data sets are submitted.
}
\details{
One record per subject.
