## Getting Started

Starting in `R 3.6.0` the default kind of under-the-hood random-number generator was changed.
Now, in order to get the results from `set.seed()` to match, you have to first call the
function `RNGkind(sample.kind = "Rounding")`.

It throws the expected warning:

```
Warning: non-uniform 'Rounding' sampler used
```

## Code Maintenance

Currently, when a `random.cdisc.data` data-generating function is created or modified, then the below code chunk must
be run to build the new/updated cached dataset and add it to the `data/` directory. If a dataset that is a dependency
for another dataset has been updated then the dependent dataset will also be updated. To manually specify which
datasets should be updated, edit the `data_to_update` vector below, entering the desired dataset names.

## Update Cached Data

**Note:** Prior to running the following code chunk, please ensure that you have reinstalled the `random.cdisc.data`
package after completing all dataset modifications. Or use `devtools::load_all()` to reload functions. Execute the `data-raw/rebuild_cached_data.R` script to create, compare and save cached data to the `data/` directory.
